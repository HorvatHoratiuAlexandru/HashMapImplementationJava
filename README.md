# HashMapImplementationJava

Implemented HashMap in java so I could better understand how it works.

myHashMap features:

put /adds a key-value pair to the HashMap;
get /returns from the HashMap the value object based on the key;
remove / removes a key-value pair from the HashMap;
printMap /prints all the HashMap contents in [(Key: KeyObject Value: ValueObject) ... ];
